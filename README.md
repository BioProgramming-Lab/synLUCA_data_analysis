# synLUCA_data_analysis
Quantitative analysis of spatial fluorescence was performed using a custom Python-based pipeline. Filament boundaries were manually annotated in each image using LabelMe (https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) to generate polygon masks. These masks were then processed with the Skan library to extract filament skeletons, with the longest path defined as the principal axis. The filament image was then computationally straightened along this axis using bilinear interpolation to facilitate the calculation of fluorescence profiles along the principal axis. The straightened axis was divided into N equal-length bins (see analysis code), and integrated fluorescence was calculated for each bin. Fluorescence intensity profiles and kymographs were normalized by dividing all raw intensity values by the global maximum intensity recorded across the entire dataset. This scaled all data between 0 and 1, preserving the relative brightness between individual samples. For visualization, the resulting intensity profiles were smoothed using cubic spline interpolation. All normalization and quantification steps were performed independently for each fluorescence channel.
